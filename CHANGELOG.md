# Changelog

## v0.3.1

- Add support for specifying a custom TypeScript compiler

## v0.3.0

- Change how modules are resolved. Imports and declaration file references are
now resolved through TypeScript instead of being resolved through webpack's

work as a replacement for the `tsc` command. (#3, #4, #5)
