# yarn - fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin

This also uses the PR of `pnp-webpack-plugin`: https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin/pull/10 that supplies includes `resolveTypeReferenceDirective`.  Hopefully that should be merged / released in future.

```shell
# Download the npm packages you need (including the type definitions from DefinitelyTyped)
yarn install

# run dev server
yarn start

# OR

# build in production mode
yarn build 
```
