ERROR in ./lib/index.ts
Module build failed: Error: Could not find output JavaScript file for input lib/index.ts (looked at lib/index.js).
The input file is part of a project reference located at lib/tsconfig.json, so ts-loader is looking for the projectâ€™s pre-built output on disk. Try running `tsc --build` to build project references.
