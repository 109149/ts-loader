# TypeScript loader for webpack

## Usage

### Installation

```
npm install ts-loader
```

### Configuration

```
module.exports = {
    entry: './app.ts',
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.js', '.ts']
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /\.ts$/, loader: 'ts-loader' }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Declaration files

All declaration files should be resolvable from the entry file. The easiest way
to do this is to create a `_references.d.ts` file which contains references to
all of your declaration files. Then reference `_references.d.ts` from your
entry file.

_references.d.ts
```
///<reference path="path/to/declaration.d.ts" />
///<reference path="path/to/another/declaration.d.ts" />
```

app.ts
```
///<reference path="path/to/_references.d.ts" />

import MyClass = require('./MyClass');

...

```

### Loading other resources and code splitting

Loading css and other resources is possible but you will need to make sure that
you have defined the `require` function in a declaration file.

```
declare var require: {
    <T>(path: string): T;
    (paths: string[], callback: (...modules: any[]) => void): void;
    ensure: (paths: string[], callback: (require: <T>(path: string) => T) => void) => void;
};
```

Then you can simply require assets or chunks per the [webpack documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs).

```
require('!style!css!./style.css');
```

### React JSX

Please see [ts-jsx-loader](https://github.com/jbrantly/ts-jsx-loader)
