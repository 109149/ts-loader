# TypeScript loader for webpack

## Usage

### Installation

```
npm install ts-loader
```

### Upgrading

Take advantage of the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE.md).

### Running

Use webpack like normal, including `webpack --watch` and `webpack-dev-server`, or through another
build system using the [Node.js API](http://webpack.github.io/docs/node.js-api.html).

### Configuration

1. Add `.ts` as a resolvable extension.
2. Configure all files with a `.ts` extension to be handled by `ts-loader`.

```
module.exports = {
    entry: './app.ts',
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.ts', '.js']
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /\.ts$/, loader: 'ts-loader' }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Options

Most TypeScript-related options should be set using a 
[tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json)
file. There are a few loader-specific options you can set although in general
you should not need to.

##### silent *(boolean) (default=false)*

If true, no console.log messages will be emitted. Note that most error
messages are emitted via webpack which is not affected by this flag.

##### compiler *(string) (default='typescript')*

Allows use of TypeScript compilers other than the official one. Should be
set to the NPM name of the compiler.

##### instance *(string)*

Advanced option to force files to go through different instances of the
TypeScript compiler. Can be used to force segregation between different parts
of your code.

##### configFileName *(string) (default='tsconfig.json')*

Allows you to specify a custom configuration file.

### Loading other resources and code splitting

Loading css and other resources is possible but you will need to make sure that
you have defined the `require` function in a declaration file.

```
declare var require: {
    <T>(path: string): T;
    (paths: string[], callback: (...modules: any[]) => void): void;
    ensure: (paths: string[], callback: (require: <T>(path: string) => T) => void) => void;
};
```

Then you can simply require assets or chunks per the [webpack documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs).

```
require('!style!css!./style.css');
```

### React JSX

This loader supports using [jsx-typescript](https://github.com/fdecampredon/jsx-typescript).
Simply install jsx-typescript and use the `compiler=jsx-typescript` option. Note that you
will need to use ts-loader@0.3.x in order to use this as 0.4.x and above is not API-compatible. 

You may also be interested in using [ts-jsx-loader](https://github.com/jbrantly/ts-jsx-loader).

## Building from source

```
tsd reinstall
npm install
tsc index.ts --module commonjs
```
