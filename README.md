# TypeScript loader for webpack

## Usage

A step by step tutorial is [available here](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-webpack/).

### Installation

```
npm install ts-loader
```

### Upgrading

Take advantage of the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE.md).

### Running

Use webpack like normal, including `webpack --watch` and `webpack-dev-server`, or through another
build system using the [Node.js API](http://webpack.github.io/docs/node.js-api.html).

### Compatibility

The current version is compatible with TypeScript 1.5 and with the nightly build using [ntypescript](https://github.com/basarat/ntypescript) (use the `compiler` option, see below). You may experience issues using the nightly build due to its nature. Please feel free to report any such issues so that they can be fixed promptly.

### Configuration

1. Add `.ts` and `.tsx` as a resolvable extension.
2. Configure all files with a `.ts` and `.tsx` extension to be handled by `ts-loader` in your `webpack.config.js`.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      entry: './app.ts',
      output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js'
      },
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.ts', '.tsx', '.js']
      },
      module: {
        loaders: [
          { test: /\.ts(x?)$/, loader: 'ts-loader' }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

3. Add a `tsconfig.json` file.

    ```javascript
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "sourceMap": true
      },
      "files": [
        "path/to/declaration.d.ts"
      ]
    }
    ```

Your [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json) file controls
TypeScript-related options so that your IDE, the `tsc` command, and this loader all share the 
same options. The `files` property should generally be specified even if its just an empty array.
If the `files` property is not specified, then **all** TypeScript files in the directory and
subdirectories will be included, possibly even ones that should not be.

#### Options

Most TypeScript-related options should be set using a 
[tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json)
file. There are a few loader-specific options you can set although in general
you should not need to. These can be set either using a query when specifying
the loader or through the `ts` property in the webpack configuration.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // specify option using query
      { test: /\.ts$/, loader: 'ts-loader?compiler=ntypescript' }
    ]
  },
  // specify option using `ts` property
  ts: {
    compiler: 'ntypescript'
  }
}
```

##### silent *(boolean) (default=false)*

If true, no console.log messages will be emitted. Note that most error
messages are emitted via webpack which is not affected by this flag.

##### compiler *(string) (default='typescript')*

Allows use of TypeScript compilers other than the official one. Should be
set to the NPM name of the compiler. Especially useful for the [nightly
build of TypeScript](https://github.com/basarat/ntypescript).

##### instance *(string)*

Advanced option to force files to go through different instances of the
TypeScript compiler. Can be used to force segregation between different parts
of your code.

##### configFileName *(string) (default='tsconfig.json')*

Allows you to specify a custom configuration file.

### Loading other resources and code splitting

Loading css and other resources is possible but you will need to make sure that
you have defined the `require` function in a declaration file.

```
declare var require: {
    <T>(path: string): T;
    (paths: string[], callback: (...modules: any[]) => void): void;
    ensure: (paths: string[], callback: (require: <T>(path: string) => T) => void) => void;
};
```

Then you can simply require assets or chunks per the [webpack documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs).

```
require('!style!css!./style.css');
```

The same basic process is required for code splitting. In this case, you `import` modules you need but you
don't directly use them. Instead you require them at [split points](http://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html#defining-a-split-point). 
See [this example](test/codeSplitting) for more details. 

### React JSX

This loader supports using [jsx-typescript](https://github.com/fdecampredon/jsx-typescript).
Simply install jsx-typescript and use the `compiler=jsx-typescript` option. Note that you
will need to use ts-loader@0.3.x in order to use this as 0.4.x and above is not API-compatible. 

You may also be interested in using [ts-jsx-loader](https://github.com/jbrantly/ts-jsx-loader).

If you like living on the edge, the nightly version of TypeScript supports JSX natively. See
the [JSX test](test/jsx) for an example.
